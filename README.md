# tcr_kata

My repo for TCR and TDD katas. I figured I would make it public as the collection of katas that I find and perhaps create may be useful to some people.

# TCR

TCR or **test && commit || revert** is a programming workflow created by Kent Beck. (Original article [here](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864).)

In short TCR is done by creating a script that runs yours tests, and then depending on whether they pass or not, either commit your changes or reset back to the last state that passed the tests.

# Katas
