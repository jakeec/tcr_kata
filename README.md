# TCR

TCR or **test && commit || revert** is a programming workflow created by Kent Beck. (Original article [here](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864).)

In short TCR is done by creating a script that runs yours tests, and then depending on whether they pass or not, either commit your changes or reset back to the last state that passed the tests.
